After logging in you will be able to see how your most recent predictions match
up. With 3 points for an exact score and 1 point for the correct result there
are up to 30 points to score each weekend of the season.
<br />
There's even a form guide for the home and away teams to help you decide who
is most likely to get the result.
<br />
Predictions can be made right up until until kick-off.
<br />
If you're in a team with friends you can see who is performing the best and
who has predicted the most exact scores.

After the results have been posted you can leave messages for other members
of your team.

The top five users are calculated by dividing the total number of points by the
number of predictions made.
